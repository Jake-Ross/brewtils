Contributing to the Bindings
=========

Since many people have many different uses for Beergarden, it makes sense that you may need functionality that's not currently supported. If that's the case, and you think you can add the functionality yourself, feel free! Here's the easiest way to make changes:

1. Clone or fork the project (`git clone git@github.com:beer-garden/brewtils.git`)
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b my_amazing_feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "It's done!"`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my_amazing_feature`)
5. Create a new Merge Request in GitHub (https://github.com/beer-garden/brewtils/merge_requests/new)

We want to do everything we can to make sure we're delivering robust software. So we just ask that before submitting a merge request you:

1. Make sure all the existing tests work (`nosetests` for the Python bindings)
2. Create new tests for the functionality you've created. These should work too :)

Finally, __thank you for your contribution!__ Your help is very much appreciated by the Beergarden developers and users.
